# mask_detector_webapp
Previously Built Mask Detector Project but inside a WebApp

Hello !

As you may be aware right now, I have created a simple mask detector project before. Now, I want to put the project on a web app so that everyone can try my mask detector in your own web browser. 

## What I have done 
* Create a simple webapp that opens webcam. You can do this by running the app and go to localhost:5000 in the browser.

## What to do next
* Feed the webcam information into the model
